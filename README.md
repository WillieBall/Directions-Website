This website allows the user to get direction from their current location to where they would like to go. It uses TomTom's API, which is known to be difficult to use. The user can choose different types of filters for their directions. Users may get direction using the fastest route, least amount of hills, most amount of hills, no highways, and least amount of traffic. The history for each user's direction are saved on an SQLite database so that users can see their history of searches. The site also uses bootstrap for the CSS along with some custom CSS.
